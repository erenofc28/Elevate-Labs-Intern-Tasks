i just shown a simple linear regression model implementation using house price prediction ,
1.  i removed some less important columns from the dataset
2.  label encoded catogorical columns
3.  splitted training and testing data using train test spilt
4.  standardized training and testing data using StandardScaler 
5.  fitted my linear regression model
6.  evaluated my model predictions using MSE and r2 score
